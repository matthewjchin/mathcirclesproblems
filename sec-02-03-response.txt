By folding the overhead knot with the thin strip of paper, a perfect regular pentagon is formed because of the regular polygons that are made after the knot is formed. 
The perfect regular pentagon is formed by at minimum three isosceles trapezoids. If folding the rest of the strip of paper, more and more of these isosceles trapezoids 
will be formed in the shape of the regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has a total of 720 degrees with its five sides, which means that each angle is 144 degrees. 
Forming a knot with a strip of paper results in the formation of several trapezoids, mostly isosceles, with the exception of the ends which are trapezoids with two 
right angles which may be the ends of the strip of paper being used to make a knot around.
