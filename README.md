# mathcirclesproblems

This is a collection of problems and exercises that were solved as part of a final examination for <b>Mathematical Circles</b> (MATH 314) at the University of San Francisco for the Fall 2020 term, with Professor Paul Zeitz, Professor of Mathematics Emeritus. 

There are a mix of both <b>Python</b> and <b>Jupyter</b> documents where some questions required coding in Python as an effective method of problem solving in mathematics. 

Not all problems are solved but are formed from several kinds of ideas as part of different thought processes. Some questions involve geometry and symmetry, while others include probability and combinatorics. 

Over the course of time, I hope to continue adding more content to this repository with the use of computer programming languages because such can be used as methods of problem solving in mathematics and related disciplines.
